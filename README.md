### What are "Concord Extensibility Samples"?
[Concord](https://github.com/Microsoft/ConcordExtensibilitySamples/wiki/Overview) is the code name for Visual Studio's new debug engine that first shipped in Visual Studio 2012. Concord was designed to be extensible and this repo contains samples of these extensions.

The samples in this repo currently target Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.0). For older versions of these samples, please see the [VS16 branch](https://github.com/Microsoft/ConcordExtensibilitySamples/tree/VS16).
